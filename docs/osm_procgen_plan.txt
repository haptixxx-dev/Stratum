================================================================================

Stratum v1.0 is a 3D city editor and visualization tool with two core modes:
  1. OSM Import Mode - Load and visualize real-world OpenStreetMap data
  2. Procedural Mode - Generate fictional cities from scratch

TARGET: Functional editor capable of loading OSM data OR generating procedural
cities, with basic 3D visualization, camera controls, and entity selection.

        * landuse (residential, commercial, industrial, park)
        * natural (water, trees, coastline)
        * amenity (shops, restaurants, parking)
        * railway, waterway, aeroway
    - Convert lat/lon to local coordinate system (Mercator projection)
    - Handle multipolygons and complex relations

[ ] Tile Manager (src/osm/tile_manager.cpp)
    - Tile-based spatial indexing (quadtree or grid)
    - Level-of-detail (LOD) system for large maps
    - Streaming/lazy loading of tile data
    - Tile caching (memory + disk)
    - Frustum culling per tile
    - Background loading thread

[ ] Mesh Builder (src/osm/mesh_builder.cpp)
    - Road mesh generation:

        * Proper intersections and junctions
        * Lane markings (dashed/solid lines)
        * Sidewalks and curbs
    - Building mesh generation:
        * Extrude footprints to height (building:levels * 3m default)
        * Flat and sloped roof styles
        * Facade texturing based on building type
    - Area mesh generation:
        * Triangulate polygons (earcut or similar)
        * Parks, water, parking lots
    - Use Clipper2 (already in external/) for polygon operations

[ ] OSM Data Structures
    - OSMNode: id, lat, lon, tags
    - OSMWay: id, node_refs[], tags
    - OSMRelation: id, members[], tags
    - Processed structures:
        * Road: polyline, width, type, lanes, speed_limit
        * Building: polygon, height, roof_type, building_type
        * Area: polygon, area_type
